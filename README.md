# Overload
[English](README.md) | [简体中文](README-zh_cn.md)\
This mod is for VS2 to fix a problem, which is *Steve* is so strong that can takes a lot of G forces!\
Well in this mod, I'm trying to create redout and blackout when G force are stronger than player's *Maxium G Force*\
Of course, *Maximum G Force* can get better by more experience in G Force Overload(I got it in a funny way).\
And this mod depends on nothing, you can use it in any mod, not just VS2\
TODO LIST
- Fix the redout's code and blackout's code which cannot render functionally.
